Collection of my DMX512 related projects, mostly various
USB-DMX interfaces in varying levels of miniaturization.

interface/v1:
  My first Eagle-drawn DMX interface; all interfaces before
  it were made on breadboards. Features the famous FTDI FT232RL
  for USB-Serial conversion and a DS26C31 line driver.
  This is a "dumb" interface where the host needs to take
  care of the DMX protocol.

interface/v2:
  Still a dumb interface, but this one fits into a standard-
  issue XLR plug. Uses FT232RQ (same chip, smaller package)
  and a MAX485.
